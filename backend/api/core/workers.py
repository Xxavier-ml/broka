BROKA v4.0 - Background Worker Infrastructure
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Two-tier worker system:

  Tier 1 — ARQ (production, Redis-backed, crash-durable)
    • Jobs persist across restarts. Multiple instances for horizontal scaling.
    • Retry logic, timeouts, job deduplication built in.
    • Requires REDIS_URL env var + `arq` package.

  Tier 2 — In-process asyncio queue (dev / single-instance fallback)
    • Zero dependencies. Jobs lost on process exit.
    • Activates automatically when ARQ / Redis is unavailable.

Named queues: notifications, ai, fraud, payments, listings

Usage:
    await enqueue("notifications", task_send_fcm_notification,
                  fcm_token="...", title="...", body="...")
