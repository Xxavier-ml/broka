"""
BROKA - Call Session State
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Shared (Redis-backed when available) storage for call SIGNALING/SESSION
state - never audio, video, or media. Replaces the old in-memory-only
`_active_calls` dict in api/routers/calls.py, which was lost on every
Render restart and invisible to any second backend instance.

Same dual-implementation shape as api/core/rate_limit.py:
  • REDIS_URL set   → Redis-backed, survives restarts, multi-instance safe
  • REDIS_URL unset → in-process dict fallback (dev / single-instance only -
                       same restart/multi-instance limitation the old
                       _active_calls dict always had)

This module owns call METADATA only (who, what, when, state). It does NOT
own live WebSocket connection objects - those can't be serialized into
Redis and still live in api/routers/calls.py's per-process `_rooms` dict.
Relaying signaling messages between two peers connected to *different*
backend instances is a separate concern this module doesn't solve by
itself - see the note in api/routers/calls.py's module docstring.

# Hard ceiling on a session existing at all *before it connects* -

# lifetime. A backstop, not the primary UX timeout: the primary "ring for
# N seconds then show missed" pace is a client-side concern (WebRtcService
# / the VoIP screen own that timer, since only the client can give the
# caller responsive feedback); this just guarantees a session that never
# gets ANSWERED can't linger forever server-side.
#
# BUG FIX (V2 hardening, 2026-09-03): this used to be the TTL for the
# WHOLE session lifetime, including CONNECTED - so any call that stayed
# connected past ~2 minutes had its Redis session silently expire, and a
# WebSocket reconnect attempted after that point was rejected with
# "Call no longer exists" even though the call itself might still be
# perfectly healthy. See CONNECTED_SESSION_TTL_SECONDS below and
# update_state()'s renewal logic - a session is only ever created with
# this shorter TTL; the moment it reaches `connected` it's renewed to the
# much longer one.

# Renewed automatically on every transition INTO `connected` (see
# update_state() in both store backends below) - a stable, long call that
# never re-enters `connected` again could still hit this ceiling, which a

# can verify the caller is a genuine participant and derive the
# authoritative buyer/caller-role/listing instead of trusting whatever the
# client sends (Section 16) - without this, a session reaching `ended`
