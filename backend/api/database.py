    Fields below `must_have_features` were added across two migrations

    Two deliberate departures from that list, not bugs:
      - `category` stays the pre-existing display-name string rather than
        becoming `category_id`. buy_agent_subscribers.py's matching query
        compares BuyAgentRequest.category == Listing.category (both legacy

        matching path, which §35 explicitly says to preserve. subcategory_id

      - `location_name` instead of `location`, matching Listing's own
