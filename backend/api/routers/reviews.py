BROKA - Seller Reviews Router
Buyers who have completed a deal with a seller can leave a star rating (1-5) and comment.
The seller's overall rating is recalculated as a rolling average on each new review.

Endpoints:
  POST /reviews/           - submit a review (buyer auth required)
  GET  /reviews/{seller_id} - list all reviews for a seller (public)
  GET  /reviews/summary/{seller_id} - avg + distribution (public)
  GET  /reviews/my-deals   - return deals current user can still review (buyer view)
  GET  /reviews/check/{deal_id} - has the current user already reviewed this deal?
