BROKA v4.0 - AI Broker Service
Enhanced: circuit breakers, timeouts, cached fallback, multi-language support.

Fallback chain:
  Gemini 2.0 Flash → OpenRouter (Nemotron 3 Ultra, free tier - TESTING) →
  Groq Llama 3.3 70B (legacy - Groq decommissioned this model 2026-08-16;
  kept wired in, reactivate by pointing GROQ_MODEL at a live Groq model) →
  cached last-known-good → 503

Circuit breakers prevent cascading failures:
  • Gemini:     opens after 5 failures, recovers after 30s
  • OpenRouter: opens after 5 failures, recovers after 30s
  • Groq:       opens after 5 failures, recovers after 30s
