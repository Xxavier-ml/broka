BROKA - Deal Completion Rate (Volume 2, Chapter 3)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
DCR (raw) = CompletedDeals / (CompletedDeals + LeakedDeals), recency-weighted
and Bayesian-smoothed per §3.3 so it reflects recent behaviour rather than
lifetime history, and so a brand-new seller starts at a neutral 80% rather
than 0%.

Call order (both invoked from core/workers.task_recompute_dcr_and_leaks,
matching §3.7's "flag_leaked_deals() ... runs before recompute_all_dcr() in
the same nightly job"):
    1. flag_leaked_deals(db)   - §3.2: mark deals that leaked off-platform
    2. recompute_all_dcr(db)   - §3.3/§3.4: score every seller from that data

Two deviations from the doc, made after checking against the actual schema
rather than assuming it matches - see comments at each site below:
  - No agreed_at column exists or is added; Deal.created_at already IS the
    agreement timestamp (every Deal row is created at DealStatus.agreed).
  - §3.2's three leak-detection signals are implemented as two. Signal 1
    ("listing marked sold/unavailable outside of a BROKA-mediated deal")
    has no data source - there is no listing delisting/deactivation
    endpoint anywhere in this codebase, seller-facing or otherwise, so
    there is nothing for this signal to read. Signals 2 (§2.2's
    off-platform-solicitation flag) and 3 (extended silence) are real and
    implemented.

      2. No escrow payment within LEAK_WINDOW_DAYS of that (still sitting at
         `agreed` - anything in _FUNDED_STATUSES already proves payment
         happened, so is never a leak candidate).
      3. A corroborating signal - implemented as EITHER of:
           a. §2.2's off-platform-solicitation detector fired earlier in
              this exact thread (audit_logs joined back to the
              negotiation_messages row that triggered it), OR
           b. silence from both parties for a further SILENCE_WINDOW_DAYS
              AFTER the leak window closed - i.e. genuinely 12 days of
              elapsed time from agreement, with the back half of it silent,
              not just "silent recently while also >7 days old" (those
              aren't the same thing - a deal agreed on day 0 with a last
              message on day 1 would incorrectly qualify on day 7 under
              the latter reading, 5 days earlier than intended; fixed
              after an external audit caught it against this exact code).
         (Signal "listing marked sold outside BROKA" from the doc is not
         implemented - see module docstring.)

    Both evidence queries are scoped to messages at/after this specific
    deal's own created_at. NegotiationMessage has no deal_id foreign key,
    only (listing_id, buyer_id), and nothing in the schema stops the same
    buyer+listing pair from producing a second Deal row later (no
    UniqueConstraint on Deal for that pair) - without this scoping, a
    solicitation flag or silence from an EARLIER, already-resolved deal
    between the same two parties could wrongly count as evidence against
    a newer one. Same audit finding as the timing fix above.

    An agreed deal that fails #2 but has NO corroborating signal is left
    alone entirely (neither flagged nor counted) - it's "stale", not
    "leaked", exactly per §3.2's explicit intent not to penalise ordinary
    buyer indecision.

    Returns the number of deals newly flagged this run.

    Batches evidence lookups rather than querying per-candidate: with N
    candidates, the original version ran 2 queries per deal (2N round
    trips), which scales linearly with deal volume and would make this
    nightly job progressively slower - and hold the DB session open
    progressively longer - as the platform grows. Fetches all messages
    and all solicitation flags for every (listing_id, buyer_id) pair
    across the whole candidate batch in 2 queries total, then does the
    per-deal time-scoping in memory, where it's cheap.

    §3.3/§3.4: recomputes dcr_score + rank_score for every seller who has at
    least one listing (sellers with none have nothing to rank in search, so
    are skipped rather than given a meaningless SellerMetrics row).

    rank_score stores the SUM of the formula's first 3 weighted terms -
    W_TRUST*trust + W_DCR*dcr + W_RESPONSE*response, i.e. 0-0.80, NOT
    renormalised to 0-1. That's deliberate: it lets listings/service.py add
    its own W_FRESHNESS*freshness term at query time and get the exact
    same number §3.4's formula specifies (0.35*trust + 0.30*dcr +
    0.15*response + 0.20*freshness), rather than an approximation. The 4th
    component is inherently per-LISTING, not per-seller, so it can't live
    on this seller-level table - but the other three can be pre-computed
    here (the expensive, cross-deal-history part) while still summing to
    the real formula once freshness joins in at query time.

    (An earlier version of this function renormalised to a clean 0-1 scale
    and left listings/service.py to use it as an ORDER BY tiebreaker behind
    freshness. That was a mistake beyond just being an approximation: rank_
    score is a float, ties are rare, so a tiebreaker rarely actually fires -
    freshness had almost no practical effect on ordering at all. Caught by
    an external audit, fixed here by summing the true weighted terms
    instead of hiding one behind a tiebreaker.)

    response_time_score is a neutral placeholder (0.7) for every seller:
    despite the doc calling "average response time" an "existing metric,"
    grepping the repo turned up no such tracking anywhere - building it is
    a real, separate feature, not something this pass silently invented a
    half version of. The formula's shape is complete; this one input isn't
    live yet.

    Batches the DCR-computation queries across every seller in this run (2
    queries total) rather than calling compute_dcr() per seller (2 queries
    each, 2M round trips for M sellers) - same N+1 concern, and same fix
    shape, as flag_leaked_deals() above. compute_dcr() itself is untouched
    and still correct for a single ad-hoc lookup outside this batch path;
    this function just doesn't call it in a loop anymore. One smaller,
    lower-priority per-seller query remains below (db.get(SellerMetrics,
    user_id), to decide insert-vs-update) - left as-is rather than batched
    into a bulk upsert, since that would need Postgres-specific
    ON CONFLICT syntax and break on this app's SQLite dev default, for a
    cheap indexed primary-key lookup that isn't the expensive part of this
    function.
