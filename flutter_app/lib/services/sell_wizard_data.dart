// BROKA - Sell Wizard Data
//
// The "new listing" flow used to be one long scrolling form in
// sell_screen.dart. It's now split across several screens (Photos ->
// Basics -> Description -> Price -> Location -> Review), each editing
// one piece of a listing. This class is the single mutable instance
// passed by reference from screen to screen via each constructor, so
// every step reads and writes the same in-progress listing rather than
// each screen owning its own disconnected copy.
//
// Also owns the draft <-> JSON shape, replacing the inline logic that
// used to live directly in SellScreen's _saveDraft()/_restoreDraftIfAny().
// Same SellDraftStore keys as before, minus 'verifiedVideoPath' - the
// verification video capture has been removed from the sell flow
// entirely, not just hidden.
